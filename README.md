# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project built using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.  
The objective of this project is to build and evaluate linear regression models to predict house prices using structured real-world housing data.
The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Project Overview

- Load and preprocess data
- Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree)
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE
- Detect overfitting using training vs validation error
- Follow best practices for model evaluation

---

## Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

---

## Evaluation Strategy

- **Training error**: Computed on the training set (for diagnostics only)
- **Validation error**: Estimated using cross-validation
- **Metric**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
